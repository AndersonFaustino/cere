CERE CHANGELOG

[v0.2.0] 2016/05/19
    * Fixed autotools installation: now CERE can and must be installed
      with make install. All libraries were renamed with a common libcere_
      prefix. (#6)
    * ccc is now called cerec (cere compiler)
    * Fixed the documentation and renamed some configuration variables.
      To set the replay repetitions now one should use CERE_REPLAY_REPETITIONS.
      To choose the warmup mode one can configure CERE_WARMUP.
    * Fixed a capture/replay bug that could happen when global static variables
      were optimized during capture but not replay. (#51)
    * Cere flags now accepts a file of flags combinations (#24)
    * Removed the undocumented and unused dump-all mode.
    * Fixed an issue with the report generation coverage plot.
    * Fixed various bugs in cere python driver.
    * Added various missing tests.

[v0.1.0] 2016/02/24
    * Compatibility with LLVM 3.5 (LLVM 3.3 and LLVM 3.4 are still
      supported).
    * Initial support for OpenMP applications. Parallel CERE (PCERE) enables
      parallel regions capture and replay. Still experimental.
      (http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1109/IPDPS.2015.19)
    * Hybrid compilation support: CERE allows experimental separate per region
      compilation, with different optimization flags.
    * CERE exploration flags support: 'CERE flag' predict region performance
      for each requested flag.
    * Reduce test suite execution runtime.

[v0.0.1] 2015/06/15
    * Initial CERE release
