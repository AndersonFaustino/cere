cere tutorial(1) -- Example on how to use CERE
====================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

CERE allows to capture a region of code and to replay it whithout running the
entire program. Costly optimization and profiling process, such as iterative
compilation or architecture selection, can be accelerated through CERE fast
replay.

CERE automatically profiles, captures and replays every extractible region of your
application and produces an html report that summarizes the results.

To orchestrate CERE
operations one uses the `cere` command-line program which is located at the root
of CERE distribution. In this tutorial we will assume that cere directory is
located at `~/cere/`. The first step is including cere root directory in the
`PATH` environment variable:

```bash
$ export PATH=~/cere/:$PATH
```

Now try executing the `cere --help` command. As the output shows, `cere` includes
a number of sub commands that will be used during this tutorial:

```
user@ix:~/cere/$ ../cere --help

```

In this tutorial we will use CERE to replay the most important regions of the
Block Tri-diagonal (BT) solver from the
[NAS-SER 3.0 benchmarks](http://http://www.nas.nasa.gov/).

## CONFIGURATION OF BT

First enter the BT benchmark directory:

```bash
$ cd ~/cere/examples/NPB3.0-SER/BT/
```

CERE capture and replay require specific LLVM compiler passes. To easily compile
an application, CERE includes a compiler wrapper, `ccc`, which is located at
`~/cere/src/ccc/ccc`. You can either use `ccc` directly to compile and link a
program, or modify the `Makefile` so it uses `ccc`.

For BT the `Makefile` has already been configured to use `ccc`. The file
`~cere/example/NPB3.0-SER/config/make.def` contains the following definitions:

```m4
     F77 	= ../../../src/ccc/ccc ${MODE} ${INSTRU} ${INSTRU_OPTS}
     FLINK	= ../../../src/ccc/ccc ${MODE} ${INSTRU} ${INSTRU_OPTS}
     CC 	= ../../../src/ccc/ccc ${MODE} ${INSTRU} ${INSTRU_OPTS}
     CLINK 	= ../../../src/ccc/ccc ${MODE} ${INSTRU} ${INSTRU_OPTS}
```

## CONFIGURATION OF CERE

Now we have to tell CERE which commands must be used to build and run the
application. For this we use cere-configure(1) with the following arguments

```bash
$ cere configure --build-cmd="make CLASS=A" --run-cmd="../bin/bt.A"
```

cere-configure(1) saves the project configuration in the file `cere.json`.
This file is read by most of CERE passes. You can manually edit this file if you
wish to change the initial values.

## PROFILE THE APPLICATION

To determine which are the regions of interest, CERE must profile the application
and the contribution of each region.  cere-profile(1) is used to determine the
application runtime and the percentage of execution time for each extractible
region using [Google gperftools](https://code.google.com/p/gperftools/). This
command also captures the region call graph.

### Measuring application runtime

To measure the application runtime, probes are inserted at the very beginning of
the main function and at the application exit. RDTSC is used to count CPU cycles
between these two probes. To only run the application runtime measure, type:

```bash
$ cere profile --app
```

The application runtime is saved in the file `.cere/profile/app_cycles.csv`.

### Region instrumentation

Before doing any profiling or optimization work with CERE, one must select
a representative subset of regions. Usually one focus on the hot spot regions that
contribute the most to the total execution time.

cere-profile(1) can measure the contribution of each region and capture the region
call graph. It outlines every extractible region as independent functions which it
profiles using
[Google gperftools CPU profiler](https://code.google.com/p/gperftools/).  The
output is then parsed with *pprof* and converted to CERE internal callgraph
representation.

```bash
$ cere profile --regions
```

This command generates the following output files:

* `.cere/profile/graph_.dot`: dot representation of the region call graph.

* `.cere/profile/graph_.pdf`: pdf representation of the region call graph.

* `.cere/profile/app.prof`: the Google raw perftool output.

* `.cere/profile/graph_.pkl`: cere internal representation of the region call graph.

### Full profiling

The previous two profiling steps (application and regions) can be combined in a
single cere command:

```bash
$ cere profile
```

### Listing the extractible regions

At any moment one can list the extractible regions, their source code location, and their contribution to the
total running time with the following command:

```bash
$ cere regions
```

This command outputs the file `regions.csv` containing for each region, the region
name, region location, and coverage informations. If no profile information is
available cere-regions(1) will still output the region information but it will
lack per-region execution time.

## AUTOMATIC REGION SELECTORS

One of CERE's tasks is to extract the set of codelets that best represents a given
application. What constitutes the "best set" of representatives really depends on
your objective. For some applications one wants a full set of codelets that best
captures the execution time of the application; in other cases one prefers a
smaller set of codelets that is much faster to replay. CERE provide two selectors:

1. select-max-cov: chooses the set of regions that maximise the application
coverage with codelets. This method maximises the coverage regardless of the replay cost.

2. select-ilp: chooses a set of regions that provide a good tradeoff between
coverage and replay-cost. The optimization problem is formulated as an Integer
Linear Programming problem.

In both cases, the overall process is similar.  CERE chooses in the graph
generated by the profiling pass a set of interesting regions. Interesting regions
are by default regions with coverage greater than 1%. This threshold can be
configured by the user.

CERE extracts and replay the choosen regions. For each region, the error between
the replay and the original execution is calculated. By default if this error is
lower than 15% we consider this region as a valid one. This threshold is also
configurable.

You can try both selectors by running one (or all) of the following commands:

```bash
$ cere select-max-cov
$ cere select-ilp
```

You can find more information in the manual pages for cere-select-max-cov(1) and
cere-select-ilp(1).

## CERE REPORT

CERE provides a report tool to visualize in html format several informations
about the extraction process of your application.
To generate the report you can use the following command:

```bash
$ cere report
```

An example of report generated for the BT class A serial benchmark can be found
[here](https://benchmark-subsetting.github.io/cere/reports/NAS3.0-SER/BT.html).
