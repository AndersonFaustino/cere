cere check-io(1) -- Check if the region does illegal IOs
==================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

```
cere check-io [-h] --region REGION | --regions-file REGIONS_FILE
          [--invocation INVOCATION] [--force]
```

## DESCRIPTION

**cere check-io** check if a regions does illegal IOs. Illegal IOs are **open**,
**close**, **read** and **write** on files. If a region does such IOs, the region
is marked as invalid because we can't restore files descriptors or guarantee files
state in replay.

## OPTIONS

  * `-h`:
    Prints a synopsis and a list of the most commonly used options.

  * `--region REGION`:
    Selects the region to check. The list of valid regions can be displayed
    with the cere-regions(1) command.

  * `--regions-file REGIONS_FILE`:
    Input file where you can list regions you want to check.

  * `--invocation INVOCATION`:
    Selects the invocation to check. By default, only the first invocation is
    checked.

  * `--force`:
    By default, **cere check-io** does not check the region if it has already be
    done before. Use **--force** flag to force the check.

## OUTPUT FILES

  * `.cere/io_traces/REGION/INVOCATION/REGION`:
    File generated by strace to trace IOs for the region.
