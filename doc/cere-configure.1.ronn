cere configure(1) -- Configures CERE to build and run an application
====================================================================

## SYNOPSIS

```
cere configure [-h] --run-cmd=RUN_CMD --build-cmd=BUILD_CMD
               [--multiple-trace]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The first step before using **CERE** on an application is running **cere
configure**. This command tells **CERE** which commands must be used to build and
run the application.

## OPTIONS

  * `-h`:
    Prints a synopsis and a list of the most commonly used options.

  * `--run-cmd=RUN_CMD`:
    Sets the command used to run the application.

  * `--build-cmd=BUILD_CMD`:
    Sets the command used to build the application.

  * `--multiple-trace`:
    Enables tracing multiple regions in a single run.  By default, multiple
    tracing is disabled and cere-trace(1) will only trace the requested region.
    If `--multiple-trace` is activated, cere-trace(1) traces all possible regions
    in a single run (regions must be non-nested). This can considerably decrease
    the tracing cost.

## EXAMPLES

Given a simple application `app` that is built using the following `Makefile`:

```make
all: app
app: app.o
     $(LD) -o $@ $<
app.o: app.c
     $(CC) -c $<
```

The user should call **cere configure** with the following arguments:

```
cere configure --build-cmd="make CC=ccc LD=ccc"
               --run-cmd="./app"
```
